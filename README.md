# JLIPAAnalyser
A simple [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ipa_%28file_extension%29) metadata reader.

## Why?
I was tasked to create an Ad-Hoc [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ipa_%28file_extension%29) uploader. I needed the ability to get the Bundle Name, Bundle Identifer, Bundle Build & Bundle Version automatically.

## Install

#### With CocoaPods
_To be added!_

### Requirements
[__zipzap__](https://github.com/pixelglow/zipzap) - Used to get the Info.plist from the [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ipa_%28file_extension%29).

#### Without CocoaPods
_To be added!_

## Usage
